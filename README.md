# FutureWatchBot
 This Discord bot asynchronously scrapes movies from Kinorium using Playwright for browser automation. It collects data on title, original name, year, genre, runtime, director, Kinorium and IMDb ratings, and images. The data is stored in a database, and the bot provides movie information via Discord.
